** Get drae api running
Install docker and run ~docker run -p 4000:4000 squat/drae~. There are
no logs to show that is running so try requesting a ~GET~ to
http://localhost:4000/healthz. You should get a ~200 OK~.

** Run the bot
By now just run ~mix run --no-halt~

** Token
By now token is showed but It's just a test token so... I don't really care :joy:
